## Prerequisites

Goblin requires python version 3.5 to 3.8 and runs on gremlin-python drivers 3.2.4 and later.

aiogremlin is in the Pypi repository and as such can be installed through pip.

```bash
pip install aiogremlin
```

aiogremlin is an asynchronous DSL based on the official Gremlin-Python GLV designed for integration with event loop based asynchronous Python networking libraries, including asyncio, aiohttp, and tornado. It uses the async/await syntax introduced in PEP 492, and is therefore Python 3.5+ only.

aiogremlin tries to follow Gremlin-Python as closely as possible both in terms of API and implementation.

aiogremlin has a simple API that is quite easy to use. However, as it relies heavily on asyncio and aiohttp, it is helpful to be familiar with the basics of these modules.

aiogremlin is very similar to Gremlin-Python, except it is all async, all the time.

## Minimal Example

Submit a script to the database.

```python
import asyncio
from aiogremlin import DriverRemoteConnection, Graph

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

async def go(loop):
    remote_connection = await DriverRemoteConnection.open(
        'ws://localhost:8182/gremlin', 'g')
    g = Graph().traversal().withRemote(remote_connection)
    vertices = await g.V().toList()
    return vertices

    results = loop.run_until_complete(go(loop))
    # results = [v[1], v[2], v[3], v[4], v[5], v[6]]
```

The above example demonstrates how :py:mod:`aiogremlin` uses the
`asyncio-event-loop` to drive communication with the Gremlin
Server, but the **rest of examples are written as if they were run in a Python
interpreter**. In reality, **this isn't possible**, so remember, code *must*
be wrapped in a coroutine and run with the `asyncio-event-loop`.
